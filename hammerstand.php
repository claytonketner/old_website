			<p>This is my first commissioned work. A friend of mine is friends with the singer of a band called The 
			Hammers. He wanted a sledgehammer shaped microphone holder as a prop to use on stage. I did the CAD work
			and the 3D printing, while my friend modified a typical microphone stand to work with the design.</p>
